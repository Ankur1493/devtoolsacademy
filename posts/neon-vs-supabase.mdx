## What is Neon ?
Neon is a modern, serverless database platform inspired by Amazon Aurora's architecture, which separates compute and storage resources. Neon's custom-built storage engine maintains a history of PostgreSQL transactions, enabling a serverless experience with automatic scaling to zero during inactivity and dynamic autoscaling based on demand. Features like database branching and a generous free tier enhance development workflows significantly.
